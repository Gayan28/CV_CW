# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Detection

A deep learning based system to classify plant leaf diseases using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- PlantVillage dataset (~54k images of healthy & diseased leaves)
- Train/Val/Test split: 70/15/15
- Preprocessing: resize (224x224), normalization, augmentation

## ðŸ§  Models
- **Custom CNN** â€“ baseline model
- **MobileNetV2** â€“ transfer learning, best performance

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| CNN          | 0.XX     | 0.XX      | 0.XX   | 0.XX     |
| MobileNetV2  | 0.XX     | 0.XX      | 0.XX   | 0.XX     |

## ðŸ’» Application
- Built with **Streamlit**
- Upload plant leaf image â†’ get disease prediction + confidence
- Shows **Top-3 predictions** with progress bars

## ðŸš€ Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
